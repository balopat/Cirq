deferred	FFFF00	This would be good to do, but we won't get to it any time soon.
difficulty: high	FF0000	Not sure what we want to want. Affects large parts of the code base. Could easily take a month.

difficulty: medium	FFFF44	Some details unstated. Interacts with existing features. A week's work for an optimist.
difficulty: trivial	DDDDff	A couple line change that someone just has to go and actually do for it to get done.

triage/duplicate	f9d0c4
triage/needs-design-work	fef2c0	[feature requests] needs design work to prove feasibility before accepting
